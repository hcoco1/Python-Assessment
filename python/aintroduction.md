## Introduction

While applying and interviewing for cybersecurity careers, you may be asked to complete a technical assessment. These assessments evaluate your technical skills in certain areas, such as programming with Python. For example, you may be asked to do real-time, live coding during the interview, where you need to explain your code as you write it. Or you could be asked to complete the problems on personal time by a specified due date. 

You will demonstrate your learning from this unit with two problems for this technical assessment. The first will assess your technical skills, and the second will evaluate your ability to explain code.

Complete the assessment in Unit 4: Jupyter Notebook machine as your instructor(s) directed. Then, upload the file, copy the text, or link to your file in this assignment.
